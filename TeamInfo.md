## Project Summary

Our project entails using the Last Two Minute Report (L2M) for every game played in the NBA since 2015 (which is when the L2M report was first created) to create a variety of visualizations for users to evaluate various metrics such as percentage of correct/incorrect calls for a certain team, evaluating the “home court advantage,” seeing which players/teams get the most calls, and many more. We aim to allow users to break down NBA officiating to its finest parts and create even more transparency than the NBA currently provides. With difficult to read basketball jargon, large sets of data, and multiple barriers to entry, most avid NBA watchers don’t even know how to access this data. And to be blunt, the current L2M data store is quite difficult to interpret. With the help of tabulated datasets, we aim to provide our visualizations real-time after a game has been processed by the NBA for their own L2M reports. 
Our intended user is average basketball fans who: a) want to learn more about how the NBA officiates, b) fantasy basketball players who hope to use a more holistic understanding of these hard-to-interpret basketball statistics to their advantage, c) players and coaches who hope to plan for certain strategic advantages when playing highly contested games. 
While there are many more uses and potential users of the L2M data, we want to keep our project somewhat lighthearted and fun while still implementing the database design and implementation skills we learn in class.
